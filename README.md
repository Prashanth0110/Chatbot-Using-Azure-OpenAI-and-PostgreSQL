# Airline Flight Status Chatbot Using Azure OpenAI and PostgreSQL
Project Overview
This project implements an Airline Chatbot that allows users to interactively query flight and passenger information using natural language. Built with Streamlit as the frontend, users can type questions, such as:

“What is the status of flight UA123?”
“Show passenger details for PNR 12345.”

The chatbot leverages Azure OpenAI (GPT-3.5-turbo) to convert these natural language inputs into SQL queries that correspond to a PostgreSQL database containing two tables: 
flight_details (airline, flight number, origin, destination, departure/arrival times,…). passenger_details (passenger name, email, phone, flight ID, seat number,....). 
Generated SQL queries are executed against the database using psycopg2 and pandas, and results are displayed in the UI. The system also shows the generated SQL query for debugging and includes robust exception handling for API errors, database connectivity issues, and timeouts. 
Overall, the project demonstrates a seamless integration of LLM-driven query generation with a relational database, providing a smart and user-friendly assistant for airline data retrieval.

# Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Streamlit – for building the user interface
Azure OpenAI – to convert natural language queries into SQL
PostgreSQL – relational database to store flight and passenger data
SQLAlchemy & psycopg2 – for database connectivity
pandas – for handling SQL query results.

# Functionality Implemented
# 1. Streamlit UI
The Streamlit interface is the front end of the chatbot where users can type in natural language queries such as:
1. "What is the status of flight UA123?"
2. "Get passenger details for PNR 12345"
3. “Which passengers are booked on flight AA789?”
4. “What is the departure and arrival time for flight DL456?”
5. “Who is seated in 12A on flight UA123?”

# UI Features:
User Input Field: Users input natural language queries.
Generated SQL Display: Shows the SQL query generated by the Azure OpenAI LLM (for debugging and transparency).
Query Results Display: After the SQL query is executed against the PostgreSQL database, results are shown in a table format.
Exception Handling: The app handles different types of errors gracefully, providing user-friendly messages for:
LLM API errors (e.g., connection failures, unexpected responses)
Database errors (e.g., connection issues, SQL syntax errors)
Timeouts and connection issues for both the AI service and PostgreSQL database
The UI ensures that users receive clear feedback and guidance, even if the backend services encounter problems.

# 2. Azure openAI and Its Applications
# What is Azure AI?
Azure AI is Microsoft’s collection of artificial intelligence services that helps developers and companies build smart applications without worrying about complex infrastructure. One of its main services is Azure OpenAI, which gives access to powerful language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

# How We Used Azure OpenAI in This Project
In this project, we used Azure OpenAI to convert natural language questions into SQL queries. This allows users to ask about flights or passengers in simple language, like:
“What is the status of flight UA123?”
“Show details for passenger PNR 1234.”
Azure OpenAI acts as an “intelligence layer”, understanding what the user wants and creating the correct SQL code. This SQL is then executed against a PostgreSQL database to get the answers.

# Other Cloud Platforms with similar AI Services:
AWS: Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Lex
Google Cloud: Vertex AI, Dialogflow
IBM Cloud: Watson Assistant
These platforms can also build chatbots, virtual assistants, and handle text analysis or understanding.

# Other Uses of Azure AI
Azure AI is not just for chatbots. It can also be used for:
Text summarization, Language translation, Sentiment analysis, Content generation, Code completion, Semantic search
Before Azure OpenAI
Before integrating OpenAI models, cloud providers mainly offered:
Rule-based chatbots: Bots that respond based on predefined rules and keywords. Limited flexibility.
NLP APIs: Services that analyze text or speech (like sentiment, entities, or intent), but you have to design the logic yourself.
Custom machine learning models: You could train your own models for understanding text or speech, but this required lots of data, coding, and infrastructure.

# 3. PostgreSQL Integration
The project uses PostgreSQL as the backend database to store airline and passenger information. The connection to PostgreSQL is managed using SQLAlchemy, which provides a high-level interface to interact with the database, along with psycopg2, a PostgreSQL adapter for Python.
When a user inputs a natural language query in the Streamlit UI, the Azure OpenAI LLM converts it into a valid SQL query based on the provided database schema. This SQL query is then executed against the PostgreSQL database.
The query results are fetched and converted into a pandas DataFrame, which allows for easy manipulation and display. Finally, the results are shown in the Streamlit UI in a readable table format. This integration ensures that users can interact with the database using conversational language, without needing to manually write SQL.
Additionally, exception handling is implemented to catch any database connection errors or query execution issues, ensuring a smooth user experience.
